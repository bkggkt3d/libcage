1. What?
    libcage is NATs free DHT library which uses Kademlia. This enables
    decentralized key-value store and peer-to-peer communications via NATs.
    Even if both peers are under the NATs, peers can communicate each other.

2. How to compile

    libcage depends on:
        libevent (http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/)
        boost (http://www.boost.org/)

    and uses C++ compiler and OMake (http://omake.metaprl.org/index.html).
    So, please install above libraries and applications before compile.
   

    $ cd libcage
    $ omake

3. Install
    If you want to install to /usr/local, please type:
    $ omake install

    If you want to install to any other places, use PREFIX option.
    For example, to install to /opt/local, please type:
    $ omake install PREFIX=/opt/local

4. Uninstall
    If you installed to /user/local, please type:
    $ omake uninstall

    If you installed to any other places, use PREFIX option.
    $ omake uninstall PREFIX=/opt/local

    You can uninstall to delete files of libcage.
    # rm -rf /usr/local/include/libcage
    # rm /usr/local/lib/libcage*
